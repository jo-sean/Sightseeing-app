Sprint-by-Sprint Overview
You'll be working in a team of approximately five. Your team will work in two-week Sprints, starting Week 1. You will be coding:

An individual project that must use a service provided by a teammate and
A service that must be used by a teammate as part of their individual project.
Here's a high-level overview of what you'll be doing this term for the project:

Week 0: Come up with individual project ideas
Sprint 1: Get set up, find a team, get to know your team, decide who will do what project/service and how the projects/services will be connected
Sprint 2: Define project requirements, design GUI UI
Sprint 3: Implement proof-of-concept (minimum viable product)
Sprint 4: Implement additional functionality, integrate with teammates' projects
Sprint 5: Evaluate code quality, revise (refactor), write documentation
Projects
Each person on your team must create their own individual project plus a service. Your individual project must request data, receive data, and use data from a teammate's service. It must also have a user interface (ex: GUI, command-line, voice control, etc.) You must provide a service to at least one teammate's individual project.

For implementation, you get to choose your programming language.
